## User Stories

1. **As an eligible voter, I want to authenticate anonymously to ensure my personal details remain private while I am able to vote.**
2. **As a system administrator, I desire a system that is secure against unauthorized access to maintain the integrity of the voting process.**
3. **As a user, I expect to receive feedback on my actions (e.g., successful login, voting confirmation) to ensure my inputs have been correctly registered.**
4. **As a developer, I need detailed logs of system operations to diagnose issues quickly and optimize the system.**

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Anonymous Voter Authentication
- **Actor**: Voter
- **Goal**: Authenticate without revealing identity.
- **Preconditions**: Voter is registered with a unique identifier that has been hashed.
- **Main Flow**:
  1. Voter accesses the login page.
  2. Voter submits their hashed identifier.
  3. System generates a zk-SNARK proof based on the identifier.
  4. Proof is verified; if valid, access to vote is granted.
- **Postconditions**: Voter is authenticated and can access voting platform.
- **Exception Paths**: If the proof is invalid, access is denied.

### Use Case 2: System Monitoring and Logging
- **Actor**: System Administrator
- **Goal**: Monitor system and log activities.
- **Preconditions**: System is fully operational.
- **Main Flow**:
  1. Administrator accesses the dashboard.
  2. Administrator reviews log entries and system statuses.
- **Postconditions**: Administrator is informed about system health and activities.
- **Exception Paths**: None.

## UI/UX Design

### Overview
- **Themes**: Use a asthetic, easy-to-navigate design with strong privacy/security visual cues.
- **Accessibility**: Implement accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.1.

### Specific Pages
1. **Login Page**:
   - Inputs for anonymous credentials.
   - Clear action button for submitting proof.
2. **Dashboard**:
   - Status messages upon successful or failed authentication.
   - Links to vote and view previous voting activity.

## Backend Functionalities

### Key Components
- **zk-SNARKs Module**: Handle generation and verification of proofs.
- **User Management**: Manage sessions post-authentication.
- **Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging and optimization.

### Technology Stack
- **Server**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Zk-SNARKs Library**: Bellman for Rust or ZoKrates for use with Ethereum

## Cryptographic Requirements

### zk-SNARKs Setup
- **Trusted Setup**: Conduct a one-time multi-party computation to generate public parameters.
- **Proof Generation**: Utilize user identifiers to create a proof, ensuring non-reversibility.

### Security Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that no user identifiable data is stored or logged.
- **Proof Verification**: Verify proofs in a secure environment to prevent tampering.

### Smart Contracts (If using blockchain)
- Deploy contracts to handle the verification of zk-SNARK proofs on-chain to leverage decentralized security.
